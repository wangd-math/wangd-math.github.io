\item Course description: this module is an introduction to analysis in the setting of metric spaces. There are at least two advantages by adopting this slightly abstract point of view. First of all, it helps to crystallize fundamental concepts and elucidate the roles they play in the theory. Secondly, it provides a unified framework for applications of the results and techniques of mathematical analysis. This module will cover the basic theory of metric spaces and sample applications to other areas of mathematics. Is is highly recommended to students majoring in pure mathematics and to those who are interested in applied mathematics with an analytical flavour.

\item Course centents: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Definition and examples of metric spaces
  \item Convergence of sequences
  \item Topology of a metric space
  \item Continuous mappings
  \item Completeness
  \item Principle of contraction mappings and applications
  \item Compactness
  \item Connectedness
  \item Sequences and series of functions
  \end{itemize}

\item Assessment:
  Assessment of students will be based on
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a one-hour test during lecture time (\emph{tentatively} on 9, October 2012), 25\%
  \item tutorial participation, 5\%,
  \item a two-hour final examination, 70\%.
  \end{itemize}
  \emph{Any student who is absent without a valid reason from an assessment will be given zero mark for that assessment.}
\end{itemize}
