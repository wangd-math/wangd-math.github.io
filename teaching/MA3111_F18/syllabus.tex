\section*{Introduction}

In Calculus/Analysis, we studied:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  Real numbers: $x \in \realR$.

\item 
  Real-valued functions of a real variable $x$:
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x): \realR \to \realR,
  \end{equation*}
  e.g., $f(x) = x^2 + 1$.

\item 
Differentiation:
\begin{equation*}
  \beginpicture
  % \setcoordinatesystem units <0.06in,0.01in>
  \setcoordinatesystem units <0.08in,0.014in>
  \setplotarea x from -5 to 30, y from -10 to 120
  \arrow <6pt> [.16,.6] from -10 0 to 28 0
  \arrow <6pt> [.16,.6] from 0 -10 to 0 120
  \put {\small $x$}[lb] <0mm,-0.5mm> at 29 0
  \put {\small $y$}[cb] <0mm,0.5mm> at 0 123
  \put {\small $x_o$}[ct] <0mm,-0.5mm> at 16 -3

  \put {$\bullet$} at 16 60
  \setdashes<2pt>
  \plot 16 0 16 60 /
  \endpicture
\end{equation*}

\item 
  Integration: e.g., $\int_1^2 f(x) dx$.
  \begin{equation*}
    \beginpicture
    \setcoordinatesystem units <0.30in,0.22in>
    \setplotarea x from -3 to 12, y from -2 to 8

    \put {\small $2$}[lc] <0mm,-1mm> at 7 -0.3
    \put {\small $y=f(x)$}[cb]
    <1mm,0mm> at 8 7.3
    \setdashes<1.5pt>\plot 3 0 3 2.2 /
    \plot 7 0 7 5.5 /
    \endpicture
  \end{equation*}
\end{itemize}


In Complex Analysis, we study

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  Complex numbers: $~z=x+iy \in\mathbb  C$, with $x,y\in\mathbb  R, \quad i=\sqrt{-1}$.

\item 
  Complex-valued functions of a complex variable $z$:
  \begin{equation*}
    f(z):\mathbb  C\rightarrow \mathbb C, 
  \end{equation*}
  e.g., $f(z)=z^2-1+i$.

\item 
  Differentiation:  We only consider ``analytic functions'' like polynomials, trignometric functions, etc, but not functions like $g(z) = z\bar{z}$.

\item 
  Integration: We only consider the integration of ``analytic functions'', and essentially we only consider the integral over a curve: $\int_C f(x) dx$, where $C$ is a curve from one point on the complex plane to another point.
  
  Thus in general, we will NOT (be able to) define definite integrals $\int_{z_1}^{z_2}f(z) dz$.
\end{itemize}

Complex analysis has widespread applications in:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  Physics (electrostatics, heat flow, fluid mechanics);

\item 
  Engineering (aerodynamics, aircraft design);

\item 
  Other branches of mathematics such as:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 
    Computing certain improper integrals, e.g.
    \begin{equation*}
      \int_{-\infty}^\infty\dfrac{\cos 3x}{x^2+2x+2} dx=   
    \end{equation*}
    
  \item 
    The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: Every polynomial of degree $n\geq 1$ has at least one (complex) root.
  \end{itemize}
