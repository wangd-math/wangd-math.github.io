\item Course description: This module is suitable not only for mathematics majors, but also for science and engineering majors who need a rigorous introduction to the concepts of measures and integrals. It covers Lebesgue measure and Lebesgue integral in a rigorous manner. We begin complicated proofs with an introduction which shows why the proof works. Examples are included to show why each hypothesis of a major theorem is necessary. Major topics: Lebesgue measure. Outer measure. Measurable sets. Regularity of Lebesgue measure. Existence of non-measurable sets. Measurable functions. Egoroff’s Theorem. Lusin’s Theorem. Lebesgue integral. Convergence theorem. Differentiation. Vitali covering lemma. Functions of bounded variation. Absolute continuity. $L^p$ spaces. Holder’s inequality. Minkowski’s inequality. Riesz--Fischer theorem.

\item Assessment:
  Assessment of students will be based on
  \begin{itemize}
  \item a one-hour test during lecture time (\emph{tentatively} on 6 October 2016), 25\%
  \item tutorial participation, 5\%,
  \item a two-and-a-half hour final examination, 70\%.
  \end{itemize}
  \emph{Any student who is absent without a valid reason from an assessment will be given zero mark for that assessment.}
