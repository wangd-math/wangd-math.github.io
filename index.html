      <p>
	Undergraduate students who are interested in probability or analysis 
	are welcome to work on your honour projects or UROPS projects with me. 
	Concrete models, simply-stated problems, explicit computations, and 
	clear-cut results are my favourite, and hope you like them too.
      </p>

      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      
      <p>
	In the First semester of academic year 2018/2019, I teach <a href="teaching/MA3111_F18/index.html">MA3111 Complex Analysis I</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	For courses I have taught in the National University of Singapore and 
in the University of Michigan and Brandeis University, see my <a href="previous_teaching.html">previous teaching</a>.<br>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Research</h2> 
      <p>
	I work in random matrix theory. From the linear algebra for sophomores 
to the ultimate "M" theory for all the physical world, matrices are 
fantasy for generations of mathematicians. Over the last decades, ideas 
from integrable systems, statistical physics, probability theory and 
representation theory, problems from statistics, wireless communication 
and genetics, and advanced analytical techniques have been introduced 
into the playground of matrices. The result of the fusion is the random 
matrix theory. The dazzling ideas, important problems and powerful 
techniques make random matrix theory thriving, and the ubikquitous 
matrix tricks make it inviting.
      </p>
       
      <p>
	Currently I am also interested in one dimensional nonequilibrium 
particle systems in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. 
Simple-looking models like the <a href="http://wt.iam.uni-bonn.de/ferrari/research/continoustasep/">Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process</a>
 (ASEP) have deep structures, and the collective behaviours of the large
 particle systems show the same feature as those of large random matrix 
models.

	In 2014 we had a reading seminar of the paper Macdonald Processes by Borodin and Corwin. My notes are available <a href="research_notes/Macdonald_processes/index.html">here</a>.
